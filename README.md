# Breast Cancer Prediction

This project aims to predict breast cancer using machine learning techniques. It is built using Django for the web framework and leverages numpy, pandas, and scikit-learn for data processing and model building.

## Requirements

- Django
- numpy
- pandas
- scikit-learn

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/breast-cancer-prediction.git
   cd breast-cancer-prediction
   ```

2. Set up a virtual environment and activate it:

   ```bash
   python3 -m venv env
   source env/bin/activate  # On Windows use `env\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. Install the required packages:

   ```bash
   pip install django numpy pandas scikit-learn
   ```

## Usage

1. Navigate to the project directory and run the Django server:

   ```bash
   cd project_directory
   python manage.py runserver
   ```

2. Open your web browser and go to `http://127.0.0.1:8000` to access the application.

3. Upload your dataset or input the necessary data to get predictions on breast cancer.

## Project Structure

- `breast_cancer/`: Django project directory
- `manage.py`: Django management script
- `templates/`: HTML templates for the web pages
- `static/`: Static files (CSS, JavaScript)
- `models/`: Machine learning models and related scripts

## Data

The dataset used for this project is based on the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) dataset. You can obtain the dataset from [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Breast+Cancer+Wisconsin+(Diagnostic)) or use your own dataset.

## Model Building

The model is built using the following steps:

1. Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling features.
2. Feature Selection: Identifying the most relevant features for the prediction.
3. Model Training: Training the model using algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, etc.
4. Model Evaluation: Evaluating the model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
